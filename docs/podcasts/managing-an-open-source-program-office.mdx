Itâ€™s a consistent pattern at most companies: High-value data and corporate memory are stored in isolated channels on disparate systems. Old processes are protected by those who have been there the longest. The problem is, the DNA of the company becomes lost as long-time employees depart, making it difficult for new hires to find what is available, why decisions were made, and who they can look to for answers.
From the Linux Foundation office in New York City, this is "The Untold Stories of Open Source". Each week we choose an open source project or a person behind a popular open source initiative, to uncover the untold stories and details about major open source initiatives. If you work with open source, and you do whether you know it or not, you're in the right place.
